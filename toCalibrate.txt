 acc_lim_x: 0.8 #x acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
 acc_lim_y: 0.8 #y acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
 acc_lim_th: 0.8 #rotational acceleration limit of the robot in radians/sec^2
 max_vel_x: 0.5  #maximum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec
 min_vel_x: 0.1 #minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec. It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction.
